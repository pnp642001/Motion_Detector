# Motion Detector using Python

### NOTE:

For better understanding, please watch the demonstration video.

## Description

This project is about creating a simple motion detector software which will provide a log of all the motions detected.

This project is performed to show case the skills of python and how python can be used to create wonderful projects.

The power of python packages is also shown in the project.

The main advantage of developing this project is that one can have their own motion detector software and with some minor modifications in the code, one can connect with the cctv camera.
